Notes for report on what the hell we were doing for GEANT4 simulation of the TES. 
I will try to do that chronologically


[July 3 - 10 ]   

First we had to load the cryostat into GEANT4.Panos and Tengiz have simplified the cryostat CAD model provided by Laura. 

The holes nuts, screws, complicated geometry far away from the TES were removed using Fusion 360 software.

Panos managed to do that by using a python script from [https://github.com/tihonav/cad-to-GEANT4-converter#examples]

[July 10 - 13]  

We had a problem with the cryostat geometry, because it had issues with overlapping volumes. Tengiz, by method of bruteforce elimination

has found two small volumes that were overlapping and has merged them into one. The working version of the file was then saved into an stl file

and commited to github repository. 

There was a problem with loading gdml in jubail. So we temporarily resorted to use CAD mesh [https://github.com/christopherpoole/CADMesh] that 

allowed to load stl files directly to GEANT4. 

Zak was working on implementing radioactivity in GEANT4. 


[July 13 - 17]

Panos has enabled cosmic rays using CRY (Cosmic-ray Shower Library and data it provides regarding the particles spectra and direction). 

[https://nuclear.llnl.gov/simulation/]

By firing 1B muons we got a range of 5-16 muon events per every triple coincidence. The energy spectrum of muons was:

It has to be noted that the size of the TES substrate was 1cm x 1cm x 0.5cm so that number is most likely higher than expected. This is however

unimportant since both IRL and in sim the paddles were constantly detecting rays renderring useless the triple coincidence detection IRL.

Debugging the simulation

[July 26 - 28]

Using Zak's macros for radioactivity, Throium decay was implemented. We realized there is a need for low energy physics in our simulation. Since

we had energies on the scale of keV to MeV. 

[July 28 - 31]

Implementing the LiverMore low energy physics list in GEANT4.

[Aug 1 - 7]

LiverMore physics simulates secondary partiles that are produced from primary particle interaction. For this reason we had to implement Tracking 

action in GEANT4. The intuition behind it is the following: A particle that enters a detector volume from outside is called a migrant as an 

analogy to bordern control. All secondary and tertiary an so on particles are than tracked back to this first generation migrant and all assigned

its track id before it has enetered the sensitive volume. This is done so that the pulses obtained from electronics are consistant with hits

obtained from the simulation. The rational behind it is that the time difference between the primary hit energy deposition and its secondary 

particles is too small to be detected as a separate pulse in electronics. 

One problem with this method (that is fixable if need be) is that it does not trak secondary particles that are produced in non sensitive volumes.

In practice it is only problematic when the copper box is hit with a gamma and produces electrons that then hit the silicon substrate. In this

particular case the electrons are counted as a separate hit from the gamma, which is unfortunate (but happens so rarerly that we did not take it

into accound untill Sep 7, more on that later)

We got a spectrum of gammas' initial energy that have reached the substrate. It was consistant with the expected Thorium spectrum.

We also a specturm of energy deposited by gamma on the substrate.

[Aug 7 - 15]

Tengiz had been implementing gdml file structure. Essentially, instead of having multiple configurations with if statements in detector

construction file, each geometrical component was given its own gdml file. Then, each component is loaded into a config.gdml file where 

they are assembled according to their relative positions.

[Aug 16 - 28]

Writing the documentation on tes-geant github an working on Light1 geant4. 


[Aug 28 - Sep 5]

Laura came back and asked to implement the quadruple counting experiment in the simulation. The configuration consisted of three muon sabers below 

the crysotat + tes + copper box and plate. Combination of cosmic rays was fired. We were getting around 45 quadruple coincidence

events in 4700 triple coincidences (between the 3 muons sabers). We then implemented a heat propagation argument saying that only the heat that

has radiated with inverse square and was within the solid angle of the actual TES sensor visible from the point of energy deposition on the  

substrate would be registered as a TES hit. This argument has brought down the number of quadruple coincidences from 45 down to 6 out 4700. Which

is somewhat consistant with 1/1600 expermiental data observed. 

[Sep 5 - 7]

Throium + saber double coincidence experiment simulation. 





Our simulation had several configurations along its development, and currently has two. 


1. The first one that we had consisted of two paddles (one on top and one on the bottom) + Cryostat + TES. We were tryign to calculate the triple
coincidence rate between the two paddles and the TES. The result of that simulation was 

1. Cryostat + Copper Box and Plate + TES. It is used in combination with cosmic rays to simulate the following:
