Notes for report on what the hell we were doing for GEANT4 simulation of the TES. 
I will try to do that chronologically


[July 3 - 10 ]   

First we had to load the cryostat into GEANT4. Panos and Tengiz have simplified the cryostat CAD model provided by Laura. 

The holes nuts, screws, complicated geometry far away from the TES were removed using Fusion 360 software.

Panos managed to convert the stl to gdml by using a python script from [https://github.com/tihonav/cad-to-GEANT4-converter#examples]

[July 10 - 13]  

We had a problem with the cryostat geometry, because it had issues with overlapping volumes. Tengiz, by method of bruteforce elimination

has found two small volumes that were overlapping and has merged them into one. The working version of the file was then saved into an stl file

and commited to the github repository. 

There was a problem with loading gdml in jubail. So we temporarily resorted to use CAD mesh [https://github.com/christopherpoole/CADMesh] that 

allowed to load stl files directly to GEANT4. 

Zak was working on implementing radioactivity into GEANT4. 


[July 13 - 17]

Panos has enabled cosmic rays using CRY (Cosmic-ray Shower Library and data it provides regarding the particles spectra and momenta). 

[https://nuclear.llnl.gov/simulation/]

By firing 1B muons we got a range of 5-16 muon events per every triple coincidence. The energy spectrum of muons was:

It has to be noted that the size of the TES substrate was 1cm x 1cm x 0.5cm so that number is most likely higher than expected. This is, however,

unimportant since both IRL and in sim the paddles were constantly detecting rays renderring useless the triple coincidence detection IRL. 

[July 17 - 26]

Debugging the simulation

[July 26 - 28]

Using Zak's macros for radioactivity, Throium decay was implemented. We realized there is a need for low energy physics in our simulation. Since

we had energies on the scale of keV to MeV. 

[July 28 - 31]

Implementing the LiverMore low energy physics list in GEANT4.

[Aug 1 - 7]

LiverMore physics simulates secondary partiles that are produced from primary particle interaction. For this reason we had to implement Tracking 

action in GEANT4. The intuition behind it is the following: A particle that enters a detector volume from outside is called a migrant, as an 

analogy to border control. All secondary and tertiary an so on particles are than tracked back to this first generation migrant and all assigned

its track id before it has enetered the sensitive volume. This is done so that the pulses obtained from electronics are consistant with hits

obtained from the simulation. The rational behind it is that the time difference between the primary hit energy deposition and its secondary 

particles is too small to be detected as a separate pulse in electronics. 

One problem with this method (that is fixable if need be) is that it does not trak secondary particles that are produced in non sensitive volumes.

In practice it is only problematic when the copper box is hit with a gamma and produces electrons that then hit the silicon substrate. In this

particular case the electrons are counted as a separate hit from the gamma, which is unfortunate (but happens so rarerly that we did not take it

into accound untill Sep 7, more on that later)

We got a spectrum of gammas' initial energy that have reached the substrate. It was consistant with the expected Thorium spectrum.

We also got a specturm of energy deposited by gamma on the substrate.

[Aug 7 - 15]

Tengiz had been implementing gdml file structure. Essentially, instead of having multiple configurations with if statements in detector

construction file, each geometrical component was given its own gdml file. Then, each component is loaded into a config.gdml file where 

they are assembled according to their relative positions.

[Aug 16 - 28]

Writing the documentation on tes-geant github an working on Light1 geant4. 


[Aug 28 - Sep 5]

Laura came back and asked to implement the quadruple counting experiment in the simulation. The configuration consisted of three muon sabers below 

the crysotat + tes + copper box and plate. The copper plate that is a 30mK heat sink was added accorind to Tengiz's propostion that more showers

would be observed. This was done because the runs would show 0 substrate hits due to a problem of overlapping mother volume of the bottom 

scintialltors and the substrate. It was fixed. The bottom scintialltors 1,2,4 were added.  


Combination of cosmic rays was fired. We were getting around 45 quadruple coincidence

events in 4700 triple coincidences (between the 3 muons sabers). We then implemented a heat propagation argument saying that only the heat that

has radiated with inverse square and was within the solid angle of the actual TES sensor visible from the point of energy deposition on the  

substrate would be registered as a TES hit. This argument has brought down the number of quadruple coincidences from 45 down to 6 out 4700. Which

is somewhat consistant with 1/1600 expermiental data observed. 

Preliminary conclusion: the simulation and the experiment agree. NEED to prove the heat propagation and show statically that the 1 in 1600 could 

correspond to 6/4700 with high likelyhood. 

[Sep 5 - 7]

Thorium + saber double coincidence experiment simulation. 

10 million thorium atom decays were simulated registering 8.2M hits on the muon saber including alpha particles and 2.0M hits without. The 

cut was 200keV. Out of those 8 have reached and deposited some energy on the substrate. 1 of those was a double coincidence event. 

As a sanity check to make sure that all 8 events went through the saber, we removed the 200keV threshold and expected to see 8 double coincidences.

however only 6 were observed. Upon closer inspection we found out that the two missing events were due to copper box secondary electrons, 

a problem that was mentioned above. So in the end we are getting 1-3 double coincidences in 2M saber hits. With 1 being the most likely since the

other 2 events with electrons had gamma that created them and likely those gamma were not registered by the saber with 200keV threshold on. 

The activity measured by the muon saber with thorium mantle in front of it was 175Hz => 175*3*3600 = 1890000 hits in 3 hours during which the 

experiment was conducted. During those 3 hours no double coincidences were observed. The only double coincidence in the simulation had an energy of

320 keV that is close to the muon saber threshold. The real threshold is unkown since it was not meausred. For threshold calculation see the 

image below.

Preliminary conclusion, the experimental result is in agreement with the simulation. NEED statistical arguemnt for this.

Current state of the simulation (Description)

Our simulation had several configurations along its development, and currently has two used and 1 unused. 


GDML file structure:

1. Config1

Cryostat + copper box + copper plate + substrate + 3 bottom scintialltors

All kinds of cosmic rays are fired.

2. Config2

Cryostat + copper box + muon saber + thorium

Radioactive decay of Thorium 232 is simulated

3. Config3

Thorium + muon saber

Radioactive decay of Thorium 232 is simulated. This run was an attemnt to calculate the thorium mantle activity separetely from the config 2 

simulation, because file sizes produces by the muon saber directly in front of thorium are too large. It would be difficult to simulate a 

substatial number of substrate hits because they are rare and saber hits are too frequent.
